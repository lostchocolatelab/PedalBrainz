# PedalBrainz

This what PedalBrainz are all about. 

The Pedal Brainz | Left Brain is a light-controlled expression pedal that interfaces with hardware audio effects that offer expression control.
Controllable patterns of light result in the "virtual turning of knobs" when used in-conjunction with the available properties of a compatible effect pedal.

A programmable Adafruit Aruino M0 is the thalamus at the center of a huge ever growing pulsating Brainz controlling the on-board RGB DOT STAR LED.
Software can be updated and modified via USB in-order to load new patterns or to write your own using widely available LED flashing tutorials and resources.

The Pedal Brainz | Left Brain hardware platform includes three potentiometers that are used to control properties of the flashing patterns across Pins A0, A1, A2.

The main software can be found in the /LeftBrain/ directory: "PedalBrainz_LeftBrain_Software"

Additional Software Modez, Teamplates, and Examples are also available.
